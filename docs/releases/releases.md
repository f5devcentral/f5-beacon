# Release Features

This section highlights standalone features within releases of F5 Beacon. Not all features will be highlighted here, but please check the official release notes link below for a summary list. Some pre-requisites may be needed in order to recreate or mimic these features. The intent of each example is not to walk the user through the setup of an entire Beacon use-case, but rather highlight features in a bite-size format.
